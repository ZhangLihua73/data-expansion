In view of the lack of space-time resolution, the method of expanding the experimental and numerical simulation data of single ball falling vertically in liquid is proposed.
fall.m is the data expansion process in the process of single ball falling. 
RK4.m is the code for solving differential equations by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. 
f.m is a function of the second derivative.
